# xHub
 xHub is a hub core that has ALOT of features and something I've spent a lot of time on and decided to open source it. This is mainly because people say I can't code, but it's what ever!!!!!!
 
 You can do anything with this I really do not care, but just DO NOT try to claim it is yours. If you do end up using it atleast give credits <3
